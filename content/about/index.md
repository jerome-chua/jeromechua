### Things that are of interest:

- **Agentic AI.** Evaluating AI orchestration frameworks through source code analysis to understand different approaches.
- **Design Pattterns.** Working through GoF's patterns gradually, mastering just 1-2 annually for depth.
- **Linguistics.** To use LLMs well, basic understanding is vital. Alight with Chomsky's view innate language acquisition differs from LLM's statistical approach (no true understanding).
- **Software Architecture.** Building competency across all levels; aiming to develop zoom-in/out capability within 5 years.
- **System Design.** Focusing on scalable and GenAI systems; using modular understanding as foundation for new features.
- **Philosophy.** Previously dedicated Saturday mornings to Plato's Republic; also shaped by Taylor, Rawls, and Girard's perspectives on society.
