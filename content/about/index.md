I live in 🇸🇬 Singapore, & currently working as an AI Engineer.

Things that are of interest:

- **Agentic AI.** Currently going through various AI orchestration frameworks & reading respective source code to see how each frames the issue.
- **Design Pattterns.** Reading the GoF's 23 design patterns, & just focus on 1 or 2 per year.
- **Linguistics.** To use LLMs well, basic understanding is vital, I lean towards Chomsky's view that language acquisition is innate & thus concluding LLMs do not have "understanding".
- **Software Architecture.** Still a novice when it comes to all 3 levels, & the ability to zoom in/out is where I'd like to be in 5 years.
- **System Design.** Knowledge of scalable systems & GenAI systems keep giving when I truly grasp each module & scenario; key starting point for every feature that I undertake.
- **Philosophy.** I used to take my Saturday mornings off to specically read Plato's Republic, & gained alot of insight to how an ideal society could look like. Other philosophers' works from Charles Taylor, John Rawls & René Girard have greatly shaped my world view too.
