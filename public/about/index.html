Things that are of interest:

Agentic AI. Currently going through various AI orchestration frameworks &amp; reading respective source code to see how each frames the issue.
Design Pattterns. Reading the GoF&rsquo;s 23 design patterns, &amp; just focus on 1 or 2 per year.
Linguistics. To use LLMs well, basic understanding is vital, I lean towards Chomsky&rsquo;s view that language acquisition is innate &amp; thus concluding LLMs do not have &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.
Software Architecture. Still a novice when it comes to all 3 levels, &amp; the ability to zoom in/out is where I&rsquo;d like to be in 5 years.
System Design. Knowledge of scalable systems &amp; GenAI systems keep giving when I truly grasp each module &amp; scenario; key starting point for every feature that I undertake.
Philosophy. I used to take my Saturday mornings off to specically read Plato&rsquo;s Republic, &amp; gained alot of insight to how an ideal society could look like. Other philosophers&rsquo; works from Charles Taylor, John Rawls &amp; René Girard have greatly shaped my world view too.
